                    <h3>Tampa Bay Snook Population Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Our flagship monitoring project tracks the recovery of snook populations following red tide events and cold weather mortality. Through catch surveys, tagging, and genetic sampling, we're documenting population trends and identifying critical habitats for this economically important sportfish.</p>
                    <p>This multi-year study has already produced valuable data on snook movement patterns and habitat preferences that is informing regional conservation planning.</p>

                    <h3>Seagrass Health Monitoring Network</h3>
                    <p>Our volunteer-powered seagrass monitoring network conducts regular assessments of seagrass bed health, coverage, and species composition across Tampa Bay. As critical nursery habitat for numerous fish species, healthy seagrass is essential for sustainable fisheries.</p>
                    <p>Data from this program has helped identify areas of seagrass loss and informed targeted restoration projects with our partner organizations.</p>

                    <h3>Juvenile Fish Recruitment Survey</h3>
                    <p>This ongoing survey monitors the recruitment of juvenile fish to estuarine habitats, providing an early indicator of future fishery health. Using standardized sampling methods, we track year-to-year variations in juvenile fish abundance and diversity.</p>
                    <p>Results from this project help forecast fishing conditions 1-3 years in advance and identify potential issues requiring management attention.</p>
